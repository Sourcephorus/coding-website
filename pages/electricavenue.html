    Lyrics:
    Boy (boy, boy)
    Boy (boy, boy)
    Now in the street, there is violence
    And, and a lots of work to be done
    No place to hang out our washing
    And, and I can't blame all on the sun
    we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
    And then we'll take it higher
    (Oh) we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
    And then we'll take it higher
    Workin' so hard like a soldier
    Can't afford a thing on TV
    Deep in my heart, I abhor ya
    Can't get food for them kid
    we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
    And then we'll take it higher
    (Oh) we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
    And then we'll take it higher
    Oh, no
    Oh, no
    Oh, no
    Oh, no
    we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
    And then we'll take it higher
    (Oh) we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
    And then we'll take it higher
    Who is to blame in one country?
    Never can get to the one
    Dealin' in multiplication
    And they still can't feed everyone
    we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
    And then we'll take it higher
    (Oh, no) we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
    And then we'll take it higher
    Oh, out in the street
    Out in the street
    Out in the daytime
    Out in the night
    we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
    And then we'll take it higher
    (Oh) we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
    And then we'll take it higher
    Out in the street
    Out in the street
    Out in the playground
    In the dark side of town
    we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
    And then we'll take it higher
    (Hey) we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
    (Oh, yeah) and then we'll take it higher
    we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
    (Rock it in the night) and then we'll take it higher (Electric Avenue)
    (Rock it in Miami, mama, meh) we gonna rock down to (Electric Avenue)
    (Whoa in a Brixton) and then we'll take it higher (Electric Avenue)
